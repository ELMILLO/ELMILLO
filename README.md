👋 Hi, I’m Emilio Guerrero

I'm a Full-Stack Developer in progress with strong experience in QA Manual & Automation, currently working in real-world projects involving testing, automation, and product quality.
I love building things, breaking things, and then building them better.

💻 Tech Stack & Tools
Development

-Python (automation, scripting, backend fundamentals)
-React (front-end interfaces, components, state management)
-APIs, JSON, REST

Quality Assurance

-Selenium (UI automation)
-Postman (API testing & collections)
-Manual testing, smoke tests, test cases, defect tracking

DevOps / Tools
- Docker (containers & environments)
- Git & GitHub (version control, branching, PR workflow)

🚀 What I’m Focused On

- Growing as a Full-Stack Developer while leveraging my QA background
- Building automation scripts to speed up workflows
- Creating small projects to apply Python + React together
- Contributing to clean, maintainable, tested code

📚 Current Goals

- Strengthen my automation frameworks with Python
- Build a personal mini “Sofascore-style” project (API + React UI)
- Deploy projects using Docker & GitHub Actions
